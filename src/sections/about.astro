        I've enjoyed making software since 2019. I think it's a great medium to
        bring value to others, either as entertainment, inspiration, or as
        productivity boosters. I've worked with Typescript, Javascript, Python,
        C, Java, and Rust, with relative proficiency in that order.

        My focus has been primarily on making websites because they can be
        widely accessed by anyone. I've worked with frameworks such as Next.js,
        React, and Vue, in combination with cloud services like MongoDB,
        Supabase, Google Cloud, and AWS.

      <RoleDescription role="Student" order={2} client:load>
        I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying computer science, but I'm
        always interested in learning new things, technical or not. Lately, I've
        been getting into tai chi and photography. I'm also working with mobile
        apps and exploring uses of AI.
