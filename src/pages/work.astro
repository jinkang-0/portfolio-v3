      A website made for Cal Taiji, the official taiji club at UC Berkeley, to
      help promote the club and its events. I worked on this project as a solo
      developer and learned much about the importance of communication with
      clients and the design process.

      A user portal made for the Immigration Justice Project to help connect
      volunteer attorneys with immigrants in need of legal representation. Made
      in collaboration with a team of 6 as a part of Blueprint, I learned much
      about teamwork in software and the Agile methodology.

      Hack for Impact was a 24-hour hackathon that brought together students
      from across the country to build technology solutions for social good. I
      led the website development with a team of seven in a 2 week deadline
      before it went live.
