          I've been making software since 2019. I've worked with Typescript,
          Javascript, Python, C, Java, and Rust, with relative proficiency in
          that order.

          My focus has been primarily on making interactive websites that are
          user-friendly and easy to use. I've worked with frameworks such as
          Next.js, React, and Vue, in combination with cloud services like
          MongoDB, Supabase, Google Cloud, and AWS.

        <RoleDescription role="Student" order={2} client:load>
          I'm an undergrad at UC Berkeley studying computer science, but I'm
          always interested in learning new things, whether technical or not.
          Lately, I've been getting into martial arts and photography.
